![Screenshot_2025-01-26_at_4 35 27_AM-removebg-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a69ec5dd-1ba4-426d-bfa4-a2ce3dad7c94)


Pure Python implementation of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for machine learning model interpretation.

## Features

- Model-agnostic implementation
- Support for both instance-level and dataset-level explanations 
- Exact and sampled approximation modes
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Compatible with scikit-learn models

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/shap-implementation.git
cd shap-implementation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from shap_explainer import SHAPExplainer

# Initialize explainer with model and background data
explainer = SHAPExplainer(model, background_data)

# Get SHAP values for single instance
shap_values = explainer.explain_instance(instance)

# Get SHAP values for multiple instances
shap_values = explainer.explain_dataset(instances, sample_size=1000)
```
